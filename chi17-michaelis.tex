\begin{abstract}
  The development of literacy and reading proficiency is a building block of lifelong learning that must be supported in both the classroom and at home. While the promise of interactive learning technologies has widely been demonstrated, little is known about how an interactive robot might play a role in this development. We used eight design features based on recommendations from interest-development and human-robot-interaction literatures to design an in-home learning companion robot for children aged 11--12. The robot was used as a technology probe to explore families' ($N=8$) habits and views about reading, how a reading technology might be used, and how children perceived reading with the robot. Our results indicate reading with the learning companion to be a way to socially engage with reading, which may promote the development of reading interest and ability. We discuss design and research implications based on our findings.

\section{Introduction}

Reading has long had an important and established place in education, and developing literacy and reading proficiency is considered a basic and essential element of learning \cite{McCormick:1994,Freire:1983}. While classroom instruction for younger readers is an important part of this process, practicing and engaging with reading at home is also crucial for these students \cite{Baker:1997}. With drastic technological advances in the last decade, the viability of using robots as educational agents to support learning, in both classrooms and in the home, has increased dramatically \cite{Benitti:2012}. These educational robots can act as learning companions, tutors, or instructional agents and can provide individually tailored instruction to children \cite{Miller:2008}, and when used in the home, robots can support student learning and skill building to supplement classroom instruction. One type of instructional support that has proven beneficial to both learning outcomes and student engagement is the development of interest in a domain \cite{Hidi:2006}, and this support is especially useful for young readers \cite{Jones:2011}. However, little is known about how an in-home learning companion robot might provide students with support for interest and engagement in reading. The goal of this study is to explore how young readers currently engage in reading at home and how they imagine technologies, such as robots, could enhance this; to observe how they interact with a robot designed as an in-home learning companion for reading; and to explore their beliefs about how they might use and benefit from a robot as a learning companion. To pursue these goals, we developed an in-home learning companion robot, Minnie, to use as a technology probe \cite{Hutchinson:2003}.

\begin{figure}

	\caption{A study participant reads James and the Giant Peach to Minnie, our learning companion robot.}~\label{fig:figure1}
\end{figure}

First, it is important to establish a rational for choosing a robot as the agent to provide reading support. Han, Jo, Park \& Kim \cite{Han:2005} were among the first to report on testing an educational robot for children in their homes. They found that a home robot promoted engagement, interest, and learning in English; and was also considered friendlier than other learning media. These increases may be due to a robot's ability to make better social connections and perform appropriate behavioral strategies than other computerized agents \cite{Brown:2013}, and social interactions have been found to positively influence interest in a task \cite{Sansone:2005}. Other studies in human-robot interaction have found robots to be more engaging and life-like \cite{Kiesler:2008}, appealing, perceptive and helpful \cite{Wainer:2007}, and positive and natural \cite{Bainbridge:2011} than other computerized agents. This social nature of human-robot interaction motivates our use of a robot rather than a computerized agent as a learning companion for reading.

In this study we utilize research in interest development as well as in human-robot interactions to identify guidelines for supporting student engagement and interest in a reading task. Interest development researchers distinguish between situational interest, a psychological state characterized by increased focus and attention, and individual interest, a predisposition to reengage with specific content \cite{Hidi:2006}. It is believed that promoting situational interest by successfully \textit{triggering} (or catching), and then \textit{maintaining} (or holding) a student's interest during successive interactions can promote the development of emerging individual interest \cite{Hidi:2006, Mitchell:1993}. Guidelines for increasing catch and hold interest from this area of research include providing students with autonomy in choosing educational materials \cite{Jones:2011}; setting and monitoring reading goals \cite{Cabral:2015}; providing materials that align with student topic interests \cite{Ainley:2002} and that students believe they have the ability to be successful with; providing social partners who indicate interest in the activity \cite{Sansone:2005}, and reading out-loud to a social partner \cite{Rasinski:2003}. Findings from Human-Robot Interaction studies also provide several guidelines for increasing engagement during robot interactions, including: the robot making direct eye contact when speaking to an individual \cite{Mutlu:2011}; providing tailored recommendations for content \cite{Lim:2013}; expressing empathy \cite{Leite:2012}; and making reference to previous interactions \cite{Leite:2009}.

By utilizing these design guidelines we believe a robotic agent may be a powerful tool for supporting interest and engagement in reading for young readers. We have identified several specific features to be incorporated into a learning companion robot in order to promote student interest and engagement in reading. The first set of design guidelines involve the learning companion guiding students with reading, including: providing book recommendations based on topic interests, individual interest for reading, and feedback after completing a book; allowing the child to choose what book they read; and setting and monitoring reading time goals. Given that people have been found to interact with robots and other computerized agents in a social way \cite{Bickmore:2005}, the second set of design guidelines involve providing feedback and having social interactions with the children. These include: giving feedback that refers to previous interactions with the child; making eye contact with the child as they interact; and responding with detailed comments that empathize or otherwise relate to what the child is currently reading.

In this paper, we report on the use of Minnie, a robot designed with these guidelines, as a probe to gain a better understanding of how a learning companion robot may be used in a child's home, and how our design features will be perceived by the child and their family. We begin with a description of how the robot is used as a technology probe, and how it was developed. We then detail our data collection methods and results, discuss the implications of these results, and finally conclude with theoretical and practical contributions to both interest development and human-robot interaction fields of research.


\section{METHOD}
 For this study, we first developed a learning companion robot, Minnie, based on our eight design guidelines. In a manner inspired by Odom et. al \cite{Odom:2012}, we then conducted short in-home visits with families to use the learning companion robot as a technology probe \cite{Hutchinson:2003} for discussion and reflection on how a reading technology might impact current reading habits in each home. Hutchinson et. al \cite{Hutchinson:2003} describes the technology probe approach as a method with three goals: understanding the user's needs and feelings about the technology, field-testing a technology, and reflection on new possibilities for the technology. These goals are in-line with our aim for this study, because at this stage of development our prior understanding of the intended user may not be sufficient, which may limit our view of how and what the learning companion robot should do. The introduction of the learning companion into the home may uncover unknown wants and needs of the users as well as inspire new thoughts and possibilities on the learning companion's use. We intend to explore these ideas to inform design modifications to the learning companion robot prior to empirical testing. Thus, our field testing of the robot is conducted concurrent to deep exploration of the design space through the eyes of the user.
 
 We began the in-home visit by asking one child (referred to after as the \textit{main child}) to complete a short individual interest in reading survey, followed by an interview (pre-) with the family. After the pre-interview, we introduced our learning companion robot to the family and asked the main child in the home to interact with it for a short period of time (approximately 30 mins.). Following the interaction, we asked the main child to complete another short survey, this time about their situational interest during the interaction. Finally, we completed a second interview (post-) with the family. In the spirit of using the technology as a probe, we did not limit the discussion or interaction with the robot to our preconceived ideas about how, when and where the learning companion should and would be used. Rather, we allowed families to explore ideas about how they would like to or would use this or another technology for reading. The following describes this data collection method and subsequent analytic approach in more detail.
 
\subsection{Design of the Robot}
Our initial design of the learning companion robot was guided by a desire to leverage the power of social interaction to promote interest and engagement in reading. In our view a small, desktop humanoid robot with multiple methods of interaction and non-verbal expression would be appropriate. We also felt that the robot should be built on a simple, modifiable, and inexpensive platform in order to model the type of constraints inherent in an affordable commercially available robot. This intuition led us to create the robot using a modified version of a freely available 3D printable robot design from Hello Robo \cite{Robo:2016}. A more expensive pre-made robot such as the popular Nao platform, while possibly more reliable and polished, is not flexible in its physical and hardware design, and the cost would preclude many families from actual use in the their homes.

The original robot from Hello Robo stands 13.5 inches and has a static torso without any movable appendages (see Figure 1). The head and neck of the robot contain five servo controlled motions including: two closing eyelids, a pair of eyes that move laterally together, and vertical and horizontal head movements. These motion options allowed us to create specific robot behaviors to provide a life-like feel (e.g. blinking eyes), and non-verbal communication (e.g. looking directly at a person). Our modifications to the original robot included adding three pieces of hardware to the robot in order to facilitate human-robot communication. First, we embedded a speaker in each of the ear pieces to allow the robot to utilize text-to-speech responses to the child. Second, we included an RFID reader in the lower front of the robot to allow the child to respond to the robot with four color coded, pre-programmed RFID cards. Roughly, the cards allowed the child to \textit{say} yes/continue, no/stop, pause, and repeat to the robot. Third, we added a USB camera to achieve two purposes: allowing video input to process facial recognition, which we used for facial tracking; and reading visual tags (AprilTags; \cite{}) placed within books. Each time an RFID card or an AprilTag is scanned, Minnie blinks and makes a distinct beep, to let the child know that the scan was registered. The robot hardware design allows us to implement the eight design features we identified from our literature review.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Robot Interaction}

The robot interaction is based on the eight design features we identified, including: 1) providing students with autonomy in choosing educational materials; 2) setting and monitoring reading goals; 3) providing materials that align with student topic interests and that students believe they have the ability to be successful with; 4) providing social partners who indicate interest in the activity, and 5) reading out-loud to a social partner; 6) having the robot make direct eye contact when speaking; 7) providing tailored recommendations for content; and 8) making reference to previous interactions. In the description of the interaction below, we will identify where design features are addressed in parenthesis. We begin with a discussion of the general design of the robot interaction, followed by specific interaction details particular to this study.

\subsubsection{General Robot Interaction}

During the interaction Minnie, the learning companion robot, uses face recognition to track the child's position and turn its head and eyes towards the child to make eye contact (design feature 6). However, eye contact is not constant, and Minnie is programmed to make small movements of its head and eyes during the interaction. Minnie also continually uses text-to-speech software to deliver pre-programmed dialog. The interaction begins with Minnie saying "hello" to the child and providing a brief backstory on why the robot is there (i.e. Minnie tells the child she is a reading coach in training). The child is then instructed to scan and read a book, Talking with Minnie, that was written by the authors of the study, and is used to teach the child how to interact with the robot. This book is written as a story, but the content guides the child through the use of each interactive tool (e.g. how to scan the RFID and AprilTags, and what they mean), and how to work with Minnie (e.g. read out loud and scan AprilTags). The robot then asks the child to complete a topic sort activity using 10 topic interest cards (e.g. mystery, art, science, or sci-fi/fantasy) with AprilTags. For this topic sort, Minnie instructs the child to scan the topics they like, followed by any topics they do not like. The software stores this information in the user profile for the child and later uses this as part of a book suggestion algorithm. Figure 2 illustrates a child working with Minnie during the introduction process.

An example of an RFID card is superimposed on the top right, and an example of a topic interest card with an April tag on the bottom left of the figure.}~\label{fig:figure3}
\end{figure}

After completing the initial instructional phase, Minnie begins the book selection and reading goal process. During this process, Minnie informs the child of a goal for reading time that day (design feature 2) -- for this study standardized at 20 minutes in length -- before each reading session, and begins tracking the time spent reading after a book is chosen. The learning companion robot will then check the user profile for a \textit{current book}, a previously read book that has not been finished. If a current book exists, Minnie will remind the child that this was what they were last reading and tell them the page number they were on (design feature 8). The child then has the option to continue or not. If there is no current book selection, Minnie suggests three books (of the 16 available) to the child that they may be interested in reading. The suggestions are based on an algorithm that uses the child's reading ability, interest in reading, usual time spent reading, and topic interests to determine ideal page length, reading level, and topical content of a book for the child (design feature 3). The program then assigns each book listed in the library a score based on the how well they match the ideal, and creates a priority cue. The top three books in the priority cue are offered to the child as suggested titles (design feature 7). The child may chose any book they wish (design feature 1), and scan an AprilTag on the back of the book they choose to indicate their selection. Then the software updates the user profile to store this as the child's current book, Minnie confirms the title of the book with the child, and the child is asked to begin reading on page one. This marks the beginning of the reading phase.

In the reading phase, the child is asked to read out loud to Minnie (design feature 5). Minnie is programmed to make semi-randomized movements during the reading phase, which include blinking, moving its eyes, and small turns of its head in order to appear to be engaged in the reading (design feature 4). As the child reads, they will find AprilTags added to roughly every three to six pages of each book, and the child is instructed to scan these tags when they encounter them. The tag ID is linked to a specific comment, written by our research team, related to what is currently happening in the book (design feature 4). When the scan is recieved by Minnie, it blinks, makes a distict \textit{beep} and delivers the comment via text-to-speech. Each time a book tag is scanned, the user profile is updated to store that page as the current page. During the reading phase, the child may continue to read, scan the yellow RFID to pause reading, or scan the red RFID to quit reading. This phase continues until the child chooses to quit, or scans the last page of the book. At that point, Minnie enters the end reading phase.

The end reading phase is triggered by either the child choosing to quit reading, or when a book has been completed. In both cases, Minnie will compare the time spent reading to their reading goal (design feature 2). If they have met their reading goal for the day, Minnie will congratulate them, and begin shut down. Shutting down consists of thanking the child for the time spent reading, encouraging them to read more the next day, and telling the child that the learning companion robot is going to sleep. If they have not met their reading goal, Minnie will let them know how much time they have remaining to reach their goal, and ask if they should continue reading. If they chose to continue reading, Minnie asks if they would like to read the same book or a new one, and then reenters the reading phase. Otherwise, Minnie enters the shut down procedure. When a child scans the last page of a book, Minnie will ask the child whether they liked the book. The child can respond with \textit{yes} (green card), \textit{no} (red card), or \textit{a little} (yellow card). This response is stored in the user profile and is used to trigger a recalculation of book suggestion scores. For books the child liked, the topics associated with that book will be given a higher score rating, which will move books with similar topics up the priority cue. The opposite is true for books that the child dislikes. In this way, Minnie takes the child's feedback about the books they've read together into consideration for future book recommendations (design features 7 \& 8).

The learning companion robot is designed to be used repeatedly in a childs home, and the interaction can be initited any time by turning the robot on. By addressig the eight design features identified from previous work, we believe interaction with the robot may be capable of promoting situational interest for the reading task. We next discuss specific methods of interaction that were utilized in this study.

\subsubsection{Robot Interaction in this Study}
A few methodological choices were made in order to best use our learning companion robot as a technology probe during a relatively short in-home visit. This involved strategically choosing the placement of the robot during the interaction, and interrupting the child during their reading in order to facilitate further exploration of Minnie's features. We also asked the child to behave as if the experimenters were not there during the interaction, in order to facilitate as authentic an interaction as possible. Only in cases where technical difficulties posed a large barrier to their ability to proceed did the experimenter intervene.

The placement of the robot was chosen after the family was introduced to the learning companion robot. The child was asked where in their home they would likely read with the robot. Of the suggestions made by the child, we asked the parent(s) which of these areas they would be most comfortable with us conducting the robot interaction, and chose to work there. In this way, we were able to allow for as authentic of an interaction between the child and robot as possible, while maintaining the comfort and trust of the parent. 

The general design of the learning companion robot interaction was programmed as described above. However, for this initial technology probe, it was unlikely that the child would encounter many of the features due to the short duration of the interaction. To address this issue, each child was interupted after approximately 10 minutes of reading, and told that they should pretend they were tired of reading the current book. The child scanned the red card to quit reading that book, and were instructed to follow Minnies prompts. Since the reading goal would not have been met, Minnie would tell them they hadn't met their goal, and offer to continue reading. Each child was instructed to chose another book, and continue reading. Each child was allowed to read for a maximum of 30 minutes, before being asked to end their reading session.


\subsection{Participants}
 We recruited families (N=8) from a mid-sized Midwestern city to participate in the study. Most often one parent and one child participated, while one family included two parents, and two families had one younger sibling present. For each family, one main child (mean age = 11.6; age range: 11 - 12; male = 5) was asked to interact directly with the learning companion robot. All other family members were included in pre- and post-interviews.
 

\subsection{Data Sources}
  During the course of our study, we collected data from three major sources. The first type of data source were three separate surveys. One survey was completed by parents as pre-visit questionnaire on their child's reading ability and habits. The other two were completed by the main child: an individual interest in reading survey prior to working with the learning companion robot, and a situational interest survey after. Reliability for the individual and situational interest scales was measured using Cronbach’s alpha, with an alpha value of 0.7 or greater indicating, by convention, a reasonably reliable construct \cite{Crocker:2009}. The second data source was from transcriptions of video recorded semi-structured interviews conducted before (pre-) and after (post-) the robot interaction. Both interviews were approximately 15 - 20 minutes in length, with the pre-interview (\textit{M} = \#\#\# minutes, \textit{SD} = \#\#\# minutes) being slightly longer than the post-interview (\textit{M} = \#\#\# minutes, \textit{SD} = \#\#\# minutes). Finally, the third data source comes from coding segments of video recordings made during the robot interaction of about 30 minutes (\textit{M} = \#\#\# minutes, \textit{SD} = \#\#\# minutes)). The following discusses each data source in more detail.
  
\subsubsection{Survey}

  Prior to the in-home visit one parent for each family was asked to complete a questionnaire to collect some information about the main child. We asked the parent to describe, to the best of their knowledge, their child's reading ability, the amount of time their child spends reading non-school work each week, their (the parent's) satisfaction with the amount of time their child spends reading, as well as some basic demographic information (e.g. age and grade).
 
  During the in-home visit, the main child was first asked to complete a 10-item pre-survey to assess the child's individual interest in reading. This survey was developed by rewording items from the Four-Phase Interest in Engineering Survey (FIDES) by Michaelis \& Nathan \cite{Michaelis:2015} with the reading motivation language in the Motivation for Reading Questionairre by Wigfield \& Guthrie \cite{Wigfield:1997}. The survey is comprised of Likert-style items, which asked students to rate their level of agreement with statements using a scale from 1 (\textit{strongly disagree}) to 7 (\textit{strongly agree}). Scores were calculated by averaging a sum of scores from all items to produce scores on the 1 to 7 Likert scale equivalent (\textit{M} = 5.8, \textit{SD} = 0.82). The high Cronbach\text{'}s alpha ($\alpha$ = 0.81) indicates it has a high internal reliability.
 
  After engaging with the learning companion robot, the child was asked to complete a post-survey with six Likert-style items, using the same 1 to 7 scale, to assess the child's level of catch (2 items) and hold (4 items) situational interest during the reading activity. The survey was based on prior work by Knogler, Harackiewicz, Gegenfurtner, and Lewalter \cite{Knogler:2015}. Scores were averaged for catch (Mean = 5.69, \textit{SD} = 1.25) and hold (\textit{M} = 5.66, \textit{SD} = 0.97) items to produce scores on the 1 to 7 Likert scale equivalent. Cronbach\text{'}s alphas were calculated for the situational interest scale as a whole ($\alpha$ = 0.81), and separately for catch ($\alpha$ = 0.50) and hold ($\alpha$ = 0.64) scales. While the overall reliability of the situational scale was high, the subscales had lower than accepted values. Thus, we will use the combined situational interest scale in our analysis.
  
\subsubsection{Interview and Robot Interaction}
  Two sources of video data were analyzed for the study: two interviews with the family (pre- and post-), and the main child's interaction with the robot. For the semi-structured interviews, a pre-determined set of questions was used as a focus for the interaction. However, the researcher pursued ideas from the family members in a conversational style, and encouraged them to elaborate and explain their thinking. The pre- and post- interviews were both transcribed verbatim and segmented by turn of talk\cite{Chi:1997}.
 
  We video recorded a semi-structured pre-interview with the family about their current reading habits (e.g. How often do you read?); what motivates their child to read (e.g. What systems do you have in place to encourage your child to read?); and the family's familiarity, experience, and thoughts about working with technology for reading (e.g. If you had a technology that worked with you while you read, what would it do?). After the pre-interview, the main child was introduced to the robot, and instructed on how to begin working with the robot. Once they were ready to begin, we video recorded the entirety of their interaction. After the robot interaction was completed, and a short situational interest survey was administered, we conducted a second semi-structured interview (post-) with the family. This interview was about the family members' view of the robot as a partner (e.g. Did it feel like Minnie was alive?), their likes and dislikes about the robot interaction (e.g. Are there any things you would change about Minnie?), and whether they thought the robot would be a useful tool for the home (e.g. If the robot were released to the market today, would you be interested in buying one for your child?)
  
  All video data was coded using a Grounded Theory approach. In using a Grounded Theory analysis we begin with an open coding period where emerging themes were identified and defined as codes. These codes are then applied to each turn of talk in the transcripts. After initial codes were identified and applied, the reliability of these codes was examined by comparing inter-rater reliability on 10\% of the data. The inter-rater reliability was very high between coders for both pre- ($\kappa$ = \#\#\#) and post-interviews ($\kappa$ = \#\#\#), as well for the robot interaction videos ($\kappa$ = \#\#\#). We then developed axial codes for each data set to further refine our coding scheme into related categories, and then finally developed a third level of coding of major themes of our findings, which expressed relationships between the axial codes. In total we found \#\#\# axial codes that were organized into \#\#\# major themes. The findings below present details of each of the major themes, and are followed by a discussion of our interpretation of these findings.
 
\section{Findings}
The styles contained in this document have been modified from the
default styles to reflect ACM formatting conventions. For example,
content paragraphs like this one are formatted using the Normal style.

\LaTeX\ sometimes will create overfull lines that extend into columns.
To attempt to combat this, the \texttt{.cls} file has a command,
\texttt{{\textbackslash}sloppy}, that essentially asks \LaTeX\ to
prefer underfull lines with extra whitespace.  For more details on
this, and info on how to control it more finely, check out
{\url{http://www.economics.utoronto.ca/osborne/latex/PMAKEUP.HTM}}.


\subsection{Title and Authors}

Your paper's title, authors and affiliations should run across the
full width of the page in a single column 17.8 cm (7 in.) wide.  The
title should be in Helvetica or Arial 18-point bold.  Authors' names
should be in Times New Roman or Times Roman 12-point bold, and
affiliations in 12-point regular.  

See \texttt{{\textbackslash}author} section of this template for
instructions on how to format the authors. For more than three
authors, you may have to place some address information in a footnote,
or in a named section at the end of your paper. Names may optionally
be placed in a single centered row instead of at the top of each
column. Leave one 10-point line of white space below the last line of
affiliations.

\subsection{Abstract and Keywords}

Every submission should begin with an abstract of about 150 words,
followed by a set of Author Keywords and ACM Classification
Keywords. The abstract and keywords should be placed in the left
column of the first page under the left half of the title. The
abstract should be a concise statement of the problem, approach, and
conclusions of the work described. It should clearly state the paper's
contribution to the field of HCI\@.

\subsection{Normal or Body Text}

Please use a 10-point Times New Roman or Times Roman font or, if this
is unavailable, another proportional font with serifs, as close as
possible in appearance to Times Roman 10-point. Other than Helvetica
or Arial headings, please use sans-serif or non-proportional fonts
only for special purposes, such as source code text.

\subsection{First Page Copyright Notice}
This template include a sample ACM copyright notice at the bottom of
page 1, column 1.  Upon acceptance, you will be provided with the
appropriate copyright statement and unique DOI string for publication.
Accepted papers will be distributed in the conference
publications. They will also be placed in the ACM Digital Library,
where they will remain accessible to thousands of researchers and
practitioners worldwide. See
\url{http://acm.org/publications/policies/copyright_policy} for the
ACM's copyright and permissions policy.

\subsection{Subsequent Pages}

On pages beyond the first, start at the top of the page and continue
in double-column format.  The two columns on the last page should be
of equal length.



\subsection{References and Citations}

Use a numbered list of references at the end of the article, ordered
alphabetically by last name of first author, and referenced by numbers
in
brackets~\cite{Han:2005}.
Your references should be published materials accessible to the
public. Internal technical reports may be cited only if they are
easily accessible (i.e., you provide the address for obtaining the
report within your citation) and may be obtained by any reader for a
nominal fee. Proprietary information may not be cited. Private
communications should be acknowledged in the main text, not referenced
(e.g., ``[Borriello, personal communication]'').

References should be in ACM citation format:
\url{http://acm.org/publications/submissions/latex_style}. This
includes citations to internet
resources~\cite{Han:2005}
according to ACM format, although it is often appropriate to include
URLs directly in the text, as above.


% Use a numbered list of references at the end of the article, ordered
% alphabetically by first author, and referenced by numbers in
% brackets~\cite{ethics, Klemmer:2002:WSC:503376.503378,
%   Mather:2000:MUT, Zellweger:2001:FAO:504216.504224}. For papers from
% conference proceedings, include the title of the paper and an
% abbreviated name of the conference (e.g., for Interact 2003
% proceedings, use \textit{Proc. Interact 2003}). Do not include the
% location of the conference or the exact date; do include the page
% numbers if available. See the examples of citations at the end of this
% document. Within this template file, use the \texttt{References} style
% for the text of your citation.

% Your references should be published materials accessible to the
% public.  Internal technical reports may be cited only if they are
% easily accessible (i.e., you provide the address for obtaining the

    recommend table lines be 1 point, 25\% black. Minimize use of
    table grid lines.}~\label{tab:table1}
\end{table}

\section{Sections}

The heading of a section should be in Helvetica or Arial 9-point bold,
all in capitals. Sections should \textit{not} be numbered.

\subsection{Subsections}

Headings of subsections should be in Helvetica or Arial 9-point bold
with initial letters capitalized.  For sub-sections and
sub-subsections, a word like \emph{the} or \emph{of} is not
capitalized unless it is the first word of the heading.

\subsubsection{Sub-subsections}

Headings for sub-subsections should be in Helvetica or Arial 9-point
italic with initial letters capitalized.  Standard
\texttt{{\textbackslash}section}, \texttt{{\textbackslash}subsection},
and \texttt{{\textbackslash}subsubsection} commands will work fine in
this template.

\section{Figures/Captions}

Place figures and tables at the top or bottom of the appropriate
column or columns, on the same page as the relevant text (see
Figure~\ref{fig:figure1}). A figure or table may extend across both
columns to a maximum width of 17.78 cm (7 in.).



Captions should be Times New Roman or Times Roman 9-point bold.  They
should be numbered (e.g., ``Table~\ref{tab:table1}'' or
``Figure~\ref{fig:figure1}''), centered and placed beneath the figure
or table.  Please note that the words ``Figure'' and ``Table'' should
be spelled out (e.g., ``Figure'' rather than ``Fig.'') wherever they
occur. Figures, like Figure~\ref{fig:figure2}, may span columns and
all figures should also include alt text for improved accessibility.
Papers and notes may use color figures, which are included in the page
limit; the figures must be usable when printed in black-and-white in
the proceedings.

The paper may be accompanied by a short video figure up to five
minutes in length. However, the paper should stand on its own without
the video figure, as the video may not be available to everyone who
reads the paper.  

\subsection{Inserting Images}
When possible, include a vector formatted graphic (i.e. PDF or EPS).
When including bitmaps,  use an image editing tool to resize the image
at the appropriate printing resolution (usually 300 dpi).

\section{Quotations}
Quotations may be italicized when \textit{``placed inline''} (Anab,
23F).

\begin{quote}
Longer quotes, when placed in their own paragraph, need not be
italicized or in quotation marks when indented (Ramon, 39M).  
\end{quote}

\section{Language, Style, and Content}

The written and spoken language of SIGCHI is English. Spelling and
punctuation may use any dialect of English (e.g., British, Canadian,
US, etc.) provided this is done consis- tently. Hyphenation is
optional. To ensure suitability for an international audience, please
pay attention to the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item Write in a straightforward style.
\item Try to avoid long or complex sentence structures.
\item Briefly define or explain all technical terms that may be
  unfamiliar to readers.
\item Explain all acronyms the first time they are used in your
  text---e.g., ``Digital Signal Processing (DSP)''.
\item Explain local references (e.g., not everyone knows all city
  names in a particular country).
\item Explain ``insider'' comments. Ensure that your whole audience
  understands any reference whose meaning you do not describe (e.g.,
  do not assume that everyone has used a Macintosh or a particular
  application).
\item Explain colloquial language and puns. Understanding phrases like
  ``red herring'' may require a local knowledge of English.  Humor and
  irony are difficult to translate.
\item Use unambiguous forms for culturally localized concepts, such as
  times, dates, currencies, and numbers (e.g., ``1--5--97'' or
  ``5/1/97'' may mean 5 January or 1 May, and ``seven o'clock'' may
  mean 7:00 am or 19:00). For currencies, indicate equivalences:
  ``Participants were paid {\fontfamily{txr}\selectfont \textwon}
  25,000, or roughly US \$22.''
\item Be careful with the use of gender-specific pronouns (he, she)
  and other gendered words (chairman, manpower, man-months). Use
  inclusive language that is gender-neutral (e.g., she or he, they,
  s/he, chair, staff, staff-hours, person-years). See the
  \textit{Guidelines for Bias-Free Writing} for further advice and
  examples regarding gender and other personal
  attributes. Be particularly aware of
  considerations around writing about people with disabilities.
\item If possible, use the full (extended) alphabetic character set
  for names of persons, institutions, and places (e.g.,
  Gr{\o}nb{\ae}k, Lafreni\'ere, S\'anchez, Nguy{\~{\^{e}}}n,
  Universit{\"a}t, Wei{\ss}enbach, Z{\"u}llighoven, \r{A}rhus, etc.).
  These characters are already included in most versions and variants
  of Times, Helvetica, and Arial fonts.
\end{itemize}

\section{Accessibility}
The Executive Council of SIGCHI has committed to making SIGCHI
conferences more inclusive for researchers, practitioners, and
educators with disabilities. As a part of this goal, the all authors
are asked to work on improving the accessibility of their
submissions. Specifically, we encourage authors to carry out the
following five steps:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Add alternative text to all figures
\item Mark table headings
\item Add tags to the PDF
\item Verify the default language
\item Set the tab order to ``Use Document Structure''
\end{enumerate}
For more information and links to instructions and resources, please
see: \url{http://chi2016.acm.org/accessibility}.  The
\texttt{{\textbackslash}hyperref} package allows you to create well tagged PDF files,
please see the preamble of this template for an example.

\section{Page Numbering, Headers and Footers}
Your final submission should not contain footer or header information
at the top or bottom of each page. Specifically, your final submission
should not include page numbers. Initial submissions may include page
numbers, but these must be removed for camera-ready. Page numbers will
be added to the PDF when the proceedings are assembled.

\section{Producing and Testing PDF Files}

We recommend that you produce a PDF version of your submission well
before the final deadline.  Your PDF file must be ACM DL
Compliant. The requirements for an ACM Compliant PDF are available at:
{\url{http://www.sheridanprinting.com/typedept/ACM-distilling-settings.htm}}.

Test your PDF file by viewing or printing it with the same software we
will use when we receive it, Adobe Acrobat Reader Version 10. This is
widely available at no cost. Note that most
reviewers will use a North American/European version of Acrobat
reader, so please check your PDF accordingly.

When creating your PDF from Word, ensure that you generate a tagged
PDF from improved accessibility. This can be done by using the Adobe
PDF add-in, also called PDFMaker. Select Acrobat | Preferences from
the ribbon and ensure that ``Enable Accessibility and Reflow with
tagged Adobe PDF'' is selected. You can then generate a tagged PDF by
selecting ``Create PDF'' from the Acrobat ribbon.

\section{Conclusion}

It is important that you write for the SIGCHI audience. Please read
previous years' proceedings to understand the writing style and
conventions that successful authors have used. It is particularly
important that you state clearly what you have done, not merely what
you plan to do, and explain how your work is different from previously
published work, i.e., the unique contribution that your work makes to
the field. Please consider what the reader will learn from your
submission, and how they will find your work useful. If you write with
these questions in mind, your work is more likely to be successful,
both in being accepted into the conference, and in influencing the
work of our field.

% Balancing columns in a ref list is a bit of a pain because you
% either use a hack like flushend or balance, or manually insert
% a column break.  http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=balance
% multicols doesn't work because we're already in two-column mode,

\section{References Format}
Your references should be published materials accessible to the
public. Internal technical reports may be cited only if they are
easily accessible and may be obtained by any reader for a nominal
fee. Proprietary information may not be cited. Private communications
should be acknowledged in the main text, not referenced (e.g.,
[Golovchinsky, personal communication]). References must be the same
font size as other body text. References should be in alphabetical
order by last name of first author. Use a numbered list of references
at the end of the article, ordered alphabetically by last name of
first author, and referenced by numbers in brackets. For papers from
conference proceedings, include the title of the paper and the name of
the conference. Do not include the location of the conference or the
exact date; do include the page numbers if available. 

References should be in ACM citation format:
\url{http://www.acm.org/publications/submissions/latex_style}.  This
includes citations to Internet
resources according to ACM format, although it is often appropriate to include
URLs directly in the text, as above. Example reference formatting for
individual journal articles, articles in conference
proceedings is given here.  See the examples of
citations at the end of this document and in the accompanying
\texttt{BibTeX} document. This formatting is a edited version of the
format automatically generated by the ACM Digital Library
(\url{http://dl.acm.org}) as ``ACM Ref.'' DOI and/or URL links are
optional but encouraged as are full first names. Note that the
Hyperlink style used throughout this document uses blue links;
however, URLs in the references section may optionally appear in
black.
